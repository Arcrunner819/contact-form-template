This is the website for Hook & Shadow.

CPG (Current Project Goal)

CREATE A FUNCTIONAL CONTACT FORM FOR THE SITE

The form should require a name, phone number, email address, best time to call, and message box.

The form should be present at the bottom of the web page since it is a one page application.

You'll see a strange file structure occuring here that you aren't use to with regular HTML, CSS, JS static sites. Our site is built with react, which means you'll need to create a component to add to the page. Try to figure it out. Or I can show you next time we're together. Building the component would be a front end job. Adding the functionality would be back end.
