# contact-form-template
Template for a contact form. Must remain flexible for multiple uses. 

PROJECT: Create contact form for HS website and a working template for Chamber of Commerce presentation.
PROJECT CHAMPION: Jordan Ramos

SCOPE
The purpose of this project is to create a contact form that allows site visitors, interested in our services, to input their name, telephone number, mailing address, email address, preferred method of contact, best time to call, and a brief message into text boxes and then submit this information to an email address with the click of a submit button.

FRONT END
Developer: Ray Bailey
The contact form should have a clean and user friendly asthetic design that can be easily customized. The styling of the form should be encapsulated so as to allow the design to be changed in the future. The form should be rendered with HTML5 and CSS3. You must also create a thank you - success page for after the form is sent and a failure page if it fails to send.

BACK END
Developer: Chris Motola
The contact form action should send the message to an email address and should contain “Contact Form” in the subject box. The action for the form should be written with PHP or Javascript. The user should be directed to a success page or a failure page after submitting.
